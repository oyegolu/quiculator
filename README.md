# quiculator

A calculator app build using flutter 
and state management used - provider

## Getting Started

their are couple of things that could be better like 
^ if the text exceeds the field it is not visible
^ the ui is ok for devices around 5 to 7 inch after that the ui gets messed means its not flexible for any screen size
^ each time u calulate even the ans is it int it comes with .0  (that is curable right now but i am bit bored with that project i will do it later)


else - everthing works fine
